# javascript-quiz

The javascript-quiz uses predominantly javascript and the document object model to build a multiple choice quiz.

Users start with 59 seconds on the clock and will get 5 added seconds for a correct answer and lose 5 seconds for a wrong answer.

If the timer gets to zero then the user fails the quiz, if the user finishes the quiz then the time remaining (in seconds) will be that user's score.

The user can then input their initials and save their score to compare with others.
